# Vite React Project

This README file provides the steps to set up and run a Vite React project. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narkaraditya10/theWorksWebsite.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned:

```bash
cd theWorksWebsite
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the Vite development server to run the React project:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server will start, and you can view the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build for Production

To create a production build of the project, run:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The production build files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, run:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn serve
```

You can view the production build in your web browser at `https://the-works-website.vercel.app/`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` - Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build` - Builds the project for production.
- `npm run serve` or `yarn serve` - Previews the production build locally.

Happy coding!
